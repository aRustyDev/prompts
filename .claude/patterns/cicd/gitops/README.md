# GitOps Pattern

## Overview
Infrastructure and application deployments managed through Git operations

## When to Use
- Kubernetes deployments
- Declarative infrastructure
- Audit trail requirements
- Multi-environment consistency

## Core Components
1. Git as source of truth
2. Automated sync mechanisms
3. Drift detection
4. Reconciliation loops

## Implementation Files
- `github-actions.yml` - GitHub Actions implementation
- `gitlab-ci.yml` - GitLab CI implementation
- `migration-guide.md` - Migration from traditional CI/CD
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `optimization.md` - Performance tuning

## GitOps Principles

### 1. Declarative
Everything is described declaratively in Git:
- Application definitions
- Infrastructure configurations
- Policies and compliance rules
- Deployment configurations

### 2. Versioned and Immutable
- All changes are tracked in Git
- Previous states can be recovered
- Audit trail of who changed what and when

### 3. Pulled Automatically
- Changes are pulled from Git, not pushed
- Reduces attack surface
- Credentials stay in the cluster

### 4. Continuously Reconciled
- Desired state in Git is continuously compared with actual state
- Drift is automatically corrected
- Self-healing infrastructure

## Architecture Patterns

### Pull-Based Deployment
```
Git Repository → GitOps Operator → Kubernetes Cluster
     ↑                    ↓              ↓
Developer            Monitors         Applies
                    for changes      manifests
```

### Multi-Environment Setup
```
main branch      → Production cluster
staging branch   → Staging cluster  
develop branch   → Development cluster
feature branches → Preview environments
```

## Tool Ecosystem

### GitOps Operators
1. **Flux CD**
   - CNCF graduated project
   - Multi-tenancy support
   - Helm and Kustomize support

2. **ArgoCD**
   - Popular UI
   - Multi-cluster support
   - Application sets for scaling

3. **Rancher Fleet**
   - Multi-cluster at scale
   - GitOps for edge computing

### Supporting Tools
- **Sealed Secrets** - Encrypted secrets in Git
- **Kustomize** - Template-free configuration
- **Helm** - Package management
- **OPA** - Policy as code

## Best Practices

### Repository Structure
```
.
├── clusters/
│   ├── production/
│   │   ├── flux-system/
│   │   └── apps/
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── flux-system/
│   │   └── apps/
│   └── development/
│       ├── flux-system/
│       └── apps/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
└── applications/
    ├── base/
    └── overlays/
```

### Security Considerations
1. **Least Privilege**
   - GitOps operator has minimal permissions
   - RBAC for different environments
   - Network policies

2. **Secret Management**
   - Never store plain secrets in Git
   - Use sealed secrets or external secret operators
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Policy Enforcement**
   - Admission controllers
   - Policy as code with OPA
   - Automated compliance checking

## Common Patterns

### Progressive Delivery with GitOps
```yaml
# Flagger canary configuration
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 60
  service:
    port: 80
  analysis:
    interval: 30s
    threshold: 5
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 10
```

### Multi-Cluster Management
```yaml
# Fleet bundle for multi-cluster
kind: GitRepo
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: multi-cluster-app
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/org/config
  branch: main
  paths:
  - clusters/production
  targets:
  - name: production
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: production
```
