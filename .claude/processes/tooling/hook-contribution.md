# Pre-commit Hook Contribution Process

## Purpose
Share custom pre-commit hooks that solve general problems back to the community repository, transforming local solutions into reusable tools that benefit developers everywhere.

## Trigger
When a custom hook has proven valuable locally and could benefit other projects facing similar issues.

## Prerequisites
- Custom hook running successfully for at least 5 commits
- Hook solves a generalizable problem
- Hook is well-tested and documented
- Time available for contribution process

## Steps

### Step 1: Hook Generalization
```
1.1 Remove project-specific logic:
    Review hook for:
    - Hardcoded paths or names
    - Project-specific conventions
    - Internal terminology
    - Custom business logic

    Transform to:
    - Configurable parameters
    - Common conventions
    - Generic terminology
    - Widely applicable logic

1.2 Add configuration options:
    Original project-specific:
    """
    if 'src/api' in filepath:
        special_check()
    """

    Generalized configurable:
    """
    # In .pre-commit-config.yaml
    args: ['--include-paths', 'src/api']

    # In hook
    parser.add_argument('--include-paths', nargs='*',
                       help='Paths requiring special checks')
    """

1.3 Ensure cross-platform compatibility:
    - Path separators: Use pathlib or os.path
    - Line endings: Handle both \n and \r\n
    - Shell commands: Avoid platform-specific
    - File permissions: Test on Windows/Mac/Linux

1.4 Add sensible defaults:
    - Work out-of-box for common cases
    - Make configuration optional
    - Provide example configurations
    - Document all options clearly
```

### Step 2: Comprehensive Documentation
```
2.1 Write detailed README:
    Structure:
    """
    # ${hook_name}

    ## What it does
    ${clear_one_paragraph_description}

    ## Why you need it
    ${problem_it_solves_with_examples}

    ## Installation
    Add to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    - repo: https://github.com/aRustyDev/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: main
      hooks:
        - id: ${hook_id}
    ```

    ## Examples

    ### What it catches
    ‚ùå This will fail:
    ```${language}
    ${bad_example_code}
    ```

    ‚úÖ This will pass:
    ```${language}
    ${good_example_code}
    ```

    ## Configuration

    ### Basic usage
    No configuration needed for default behavior.

    ### Advanced options
    ```yaml
    - id: ${hook_id}
      args: [
        '--strict',  # Enable strict mode
        '--fix',     # Auto-fix issues
        '--exclude', 'legacy/'  # Skip legacy code
      ]
    ```

    ### All available options
    - `--strict`: ${what_strict_does}
    - `--fix`: Enable automatic fixing
    - `--exclude PATTERN`: Skip files matching pattern

    ## How it works
    ${technical_explanation_for_contributors}

    ## Contributing
    Issues and PRs welcome! See CONTRIBUTING.md
    """

2.2 Create usage examples:

## Integration Points

- **Triggered by**: Process: PreCommitHookResolution (when hook is generally useful)
- **Uses**: Process: DataSanitization (for all public content)
- **Uses**: Process: CommitStandards (for commits)
- **Uses**: Process: IssueTracking (throughout process)
- **Results in**: Community-available hook
- **Updates**: Local configuration to use official version

## Success Metrics

A successful contribution:
- Gets merged within reasonable time
- Receives positive feedback
- Gets adopted by other projects
- Generates no major bug reports
- Saves time for many developers

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Generalize thoroughly before contributing
- ‚úÖ Test extensively on various projects
- ‚úÖ Document comprehensively
- ‚úÖ Respond quickly to feedback
- ‚úÖ Support your contribution after merge

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Submit project-specific hooks
- ‚ùå Skip testing on other projects
- ‚ùå Ignore maintainer guidelines
- ‚ùå Abandon PR during review
- ‚ùå Forget to update local usage

## Example Contributions

### Successful: Import Grouping Checker
Started as internal tool to enforce import grouping standards, generalized to support multiple Python import styles, now used by hundreds of projects.

### Learning Experience: Database Migration Checker
Too specific to Django projects, required significant generalization, eventually split into framework-specific repository.

Remember: Contributing your solutions back to the community creates a positive cycle where everyone's development experience improves. Your solution to a recurring problem could save thousands of developer hours across the industry.
