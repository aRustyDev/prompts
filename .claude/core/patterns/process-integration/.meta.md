# Process Integration Patterns

## Purpose
Provides a standardized way to discover, load, and execute reusable processes across the codebase.

## Overview
Centralized process management system for discovering, loading, and executing modular processes with automatic dependency resolution.

## Components

### Process Registry
Central registry of all available processes with metadata and dependencies.
- Process discovery and cataloging
- Metadata management (version, dependencies, parameters)
- Category-based organization
- Process lifecycle management

### Process Loader
Dynamic process loading with dependency resolution and validation.
- On-demand process loading
- Dependency resolution
- Version compatibility checking
- Process caching

### Process Executor
Standardized process execution with error handling and logging.
- Consistent execution interface
- Parameter validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Execution logging and metrics

### Dependency Resolver
Automatic resolution of process dependencies and circular dependency detection.
- Dependency graph construction
- Circular dependency detection
- Version constraint resolution
- Conflict resolution

## Benefits
- **Centralized Discovery**: Find all available processes in one place
- **Automatic Dependencies**: Dependencies are resolved automatically
- **Consistent Interface**: All processes follow the same execution pattern
- **Error Isolation**: Process failures are contained and handled gracefully
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load only what you need when you need it
- **Version Management**: Handle process versions and compatibility

## Usage
```bash
# Register a new process
register_process "testing/unit-test-runner" "./processes/testing/unit-test-runner.sh"

# Load a process
load_process "testing/unit-test-runner"

# Execute with parameters
execute_process "testing/unit-test-runner" --coverage --parallel

# List available processes
list_processes --category testing
```
