# Core Patterns Library

## Purpose
This directory contains the core pattern library that provides reusable, standardized implementations for common functionality across the codebase.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Error Handling (`error-handling/`)
Standardized error handling, reporting, and recovery mechanisms.

### 2. Validation (`validation/`)
Input validation, schema validation, and data verification patterns.

### 3. Process Integration (`process-integration/`)
Process loading, execution, and dependency management patterns.

### 4. Git Operations (`git-operations/`)
Common git operations and repository management patterns.

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: Same patterns used everywhere
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth
- **Quality**: Well-tested, production-ready code
- **Efficiency**: No more reinventing the wheel

## Usage
All patterns follow a consistent interface and can be imported into any module via dependencies.
