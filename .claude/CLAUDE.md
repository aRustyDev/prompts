   2.1 Create test file if needed
   2.2 Write test that describes desired behavior
   2.3 Test should fail for the right reason
   2.4 Document test purpose: "// Test: ${what_and_why}"
   2.5 Run test, confirm failure
   2.6 Commit the failing test:
       - Message: "test(${scope}): add failing test for ${behavior}"
       - This documents our intention before implementation

3. Minimal Implementation
   3.1 Write ONLY enough code to pass test
   3.2 Avoid premature optimization
   3.3 Run test, confirm passes
   3.4 Run ALL tests, confirm no regression

4. Commit Working Code

## Process: PushFailureResolution
### Purpose
Resolve issues preventing push to remote and ensure they're tracked

### Trigger
Push to remote repository fails

### Steps
```
1. Diagnose Push Failure
   1.1 Capture full error message
   1.2 Common patterns:
       - Authentication failure
       - Remote has diverged
       - Protected branch
       - Network issues
       - Hook rejections

2. Create/Update Tracking Issue
   2.1 Search for existing push failure issues
   2.2 If pattern exists, update it
   2.3 Otherwise create new issue:
       Title: "Push Failure: ${error_type}"
       Labels: ['infrastructure', 'blocking']
   2.4 Document:
       - Full error message (sanitized)
       - Context when it occurred
       - Branch and commits affected

3. Resolution by Type
   3.1 IF remote_diverged:
       - Fetch latest: `${version_control} fetch origin`
       - Rebase or merge based on project standards
       - Resolve any conflicts
       - Re-run all tests

   3.2 IF authentication_issue:
       - Verify credentials
       - Check SSH keys/tokens
       - Update auth method if needed

   3.3 IF protected_branch:
       - Verify correct branch
       - Create PR if needed
       - Or switch to feature branch

   3.4 IF hook_rejection:
       - Read hook output carefully
       - Fix identified issues
       - Document hook requirements

4. Retry Push
   4.1 Attempt push again
   4.2 If still fails, return to step 1
   4.3 If succeeds, continue to step 5

5. Document Resolution
   5.1 Update issue with:
       - Root cause analysis
       - Steps taken to resolve
       - Time spent on resolution
       - Preventive measures
   5.2 If issue can be automated:
       Execute: Process: RecurringProblemIdentification
   5.3 Close issue with resolution

6. Update Local Documentation
   6.1 If new pattern discovered:
       - Add to team knowledge base
       - Update troubleshooting guide
   6.2 Consider pre-push hook to prevent
```

### Output
- Changes successfully pushed
- Issue tracked and resolved
- Knowledge captured for future

```

---

## Process: DataSanitization
### Purpose
Remove or mask sensitive information before posting to any public or semi-public location

### Trigger
- Before any IssueUpdate
- Before creating PRs or issues
- Before posting error messages or logs
- Before sharing debug output

### Input
Raw text that may contain sensitive information

### Steps
```
1. Determine Content Type
   1.1 Identify input format:
       - Plain text → use 'text' tools
       - JSON data → use 'json' tools
       - Log files → use 'structured_logs' tools
   1.2 Assess complexity level:
       - Single-line replacements → simple
       - Multi-line patterns → medium
       - Context-aware replacements → complex

2. Select Sanitization Tool
   2.1 Execute: Process: ToolSelection
       Parameters:
       - tool_category: ${content_type}
       - complexity: ${assessed_complexity}
   2.2 Verify tool availability
   2.3 Prepare tool-specific commands

3. Apply Sanitization Patterns
   3.1 For each pattern in ${sanitization_patterns}:
       IF pattern.complexity <= tool.complexity:
          Apply pattern using selected tool

   3.2 Tool-specific implementation:
       FOR sed (simple patterns):
           echo "${content}" | sed -E 's/${pattern.regex}/${pattern.replacement}/g'

       FOR awk (medium patterns):
           echo "${content}" | awk '{
               gsub(/${pattern.regex}/, "${pattern.replacement}")
               print
           }'

       FOR python (any complexity):
           python3 -c "
           import re, sys
           content = sys.stdin.read()
           # Apply all patterns
           for pattern in patterns:
               content = re.sub(pattern['regex'], pattern['replacement'], content)
           print(content)
           "

       FOR jq (JSON data):
           cat "${file}" | jq 'walk(if type == "string" then
               gsub("${pattern.regex}"; "${pattern.replacement}")
           else . end)'

4. Multi-pass Sanitization
   4.1 First pass: Credentials and keys
       - API keys, tokens, passwords
       - SSH keys, certificates
       - Database connection strings

   4.2 Second pass: PII
       - Email addresses
       - Names in common positions
       - Phone numbers, SSNs

   4.3 Third pass: System information
       - IP addresses
       - Usernames in paths
       - Hostnames

   4.4 Final pass: Context-specific
       - UUIDs/GUIDs
       - Temporary paths
       - Session IDs

5. Validate Sanitization
   5.1 Quick scan for missed patterns
   5.2 Check for partial exposures:
       - Key prefixes/suffixes
       - Encoded data (base64, hex)
   5.3 If unsure, apply generic sanitization:
       ${suspicious_string} → <redacted-possible-sensitive-data>

6. Handle Tool Failures
   6.1 If primary tool fails:
       - Log failure reason
       - Try next tool in preference list
       - If all fail, use manual replacement

   6.2 Fallback to manual process:
       - Flag for manual review
       - Provide pattern list for manual application
       - Mark output as "Requires manual sanitization"

7. Document Sanitization
   7.1 Add header to sanitized content:
       "# Note: This content has been sanitized for security
        # Tool used: ${tool_name}
        # Patterns applied: ${pattern_count}
        # Date: ${timestamp}"

   7.2 Keep sanitization log:
       - Patterns matched
       - Replacements made
       - Tool used
```

### Output
Sanitized text safe for public posting

### Tool-Specific Examples

#### Using sed (simple):
```bash
# Sanitize email addresses
echo "Contact: john.doe@example.com" | sed -E 's/[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+/<email>/g'
# Output: Contact: <email>
```

#### Using awk (medium):
```bash
# Sanitize paths with usernames
echo "/home/johndoe/project/src" | awk '{
    gsub(/\/home\/[^\/]+\//, "/home/<username>/")
    gsub(/\/Users\/[^\/]+\//, "/Users/<username>/")
    print
}'
# Output: /home/<username>/project/src
```

#### Using python (complex):
```bash
# Multiple pattern sanitization
cat debug.log | python3 -c "
import re, sys
content = sys.stdin.read()
# Define patterns
patterns = [
    (r'Bearer\s+[\w\-\.]+', 'Bearer <token-REDACTED>'),
    (r'password[\"\']\s*:\s*[\"\''][^\"\']+[\"\'']', 'password: \"<password>\"'),
    (r'[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}', '<uuid>')
]
# Apply all patterns
for pattern, replacement in patterns:
    content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
print(content)
"
```

#### Using jq (JSON):
```bash
# Sanitize JSON data
cat config.json | jq 'walk(if type == "string" then
    gsub("(?<key>api_key\"?\\s*:\\s*\"?)[^\"]+"; "\(.key)<api-key-REDACTED>") |
    gsub("[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+"; "<email>")
else . end)'
```

# Pre-commit Hook Management

## Hook Problem Tracking
The system automatically identifies recurring problems that could be solved by pre-commit hooks by tracking:
- Repeated CI/CD failures
- Common code review feedback
- Frequent manual fixes
- Pre-commit hook failures

## Hook Resolution Flow
```
Problem Detected → RecurringProblemIdentification
                  ↓
                  Analyze if automatable
                  ↓
        ┌─────────┴─────────┐
        ↓                   ↓
Find Existing Hook    Create Custom Hook
        ↓                   ↓
        └─────────┬─────────┘
                  ↓
            Test & Apply
                  ↓
         If custom & valuable
                  ↓
      PreCommitHookContribution
```

# Quick Reference

## Process Chains
- New Feature: CodebaseReview → FeaturePlanning → TDD → QualityReview → Submit
- Bug Fix: CodebaseReview → BugAnalysis → TDD → RegressionTest → Submit
- Refactor: CodebaseReview → RefactorPlanning → SafetyNet → Refactor → Submit
- Hook Creation: RecurringProblemIdentification → PreCommitHookResolution → PreCommitHookContribution

## Pre-commit Integration Points
- Repository Setup: WorkspaceSetup → PreCommitConfiguration
- Problem Detection: CommitWork failures → RecurringProblemIdentification
- Hook Development: Create → Test → Contribute to aRustyDev/pre-commit-hooks

## Issue Updates Required At
- After each TDD cycle
- When encountering challenges
- When finding solutions
- When identifying recurring problems
- At milestone completion
- Before submitting PR
- After creating new pre-commit hooks
