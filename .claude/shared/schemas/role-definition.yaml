## Composition Rules

### Inheritance
- Knowledge modules are merged, with child overriding parent
- Capabilities are additive (no override)
- Core identity cannot be inherited

### Conflicts
- Latest version wins for module conflicts
- Higher priority capabilities load first
- Explicit overrides in custom roles

### Performance
- Required modules are always cached
- Contextual modules use lazy loading
- High-priority roles get cache preference
