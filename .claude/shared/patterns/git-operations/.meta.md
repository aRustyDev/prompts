# Git Operations Patterns

## Purpose
Provides a comprehensive library of git operations with consistent error handling and best practices.

## Overview
Standardized git operations library that encapsulates common git workflows with proper error handling, validation, and recovery mechanisms.

## Components

### Repository Operations
- Repository initialization and cloning
- Remote management
- Configuration handling
- Repository health checks
- Submodule management

### Branch Operations
- Branch creation, switching, and deletion
- Branch protection checks
- Merge and rebase operations
- Branch naming validation
- Upstream tracking management

### Commit Operations
- Standardized commit creation
- Commit message formatting
- Interactive staging
- Pre-commit hook integration
- Commit signing support

### Status Operations
- Repository status checks
- Diff generation
- Change detection
- Conflict detection
- Working tree validation

## Benefits
- **Consistent Error Handling**: All git errors are properly caught and handled
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents common mistakes
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Helpful recovery paths for common issues
- **Best Practices**: Enforces git best practices automatically
- **Safety Checks**: Prevents destructive operations without confirmation

## Usage
```bash
# Import git operations
source .claude/core/patterns/git-operations/branch-ops.sh

# Use safe operations
if create_feature_branch "feature/new-feature"; then
    echo "Branch created successfully"
fi

# Chain operations safely
safe_git_operation checkout main && 
safe_git_operation pull origin main && 
create_feature_branch "feature/update"
```
