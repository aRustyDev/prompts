# Pattern: Deep Exploration

## Purpose
Navigate complex problem spaces by following threads of investigation deeply, uncovering root causes and hidden connections through persistent inquiry.

## Context
Use this pattern when:
- Surface-level analysis is insufficient
- Root causes need to be understood
- Complex interconnections exist
- "Why" matters more than "what"

## Pattern Structure

### 1. Follow-the-Thread Methodology

#### 1.1 Thread Identification
```yaml
thread_types:
  causal_threads:
    - Error propagation paths
    - Dependency chains
    - Decision consequences
    
  pattern_threads:
    - Repeated behaviors
    - Similar structures
    - Common problems
    
  anomaly_threads:
    - Outliers and exceptions
    - Unexpected results
    - Breaking patterns
```

#### 1.2 Thread Following Technique
```yaml
thread_following:
  start:
    - Identify interesting starting point
    - Document initial observation
    - Form initial hypothesis
    
  trace:
    - Follow connections step by step
    - Document each step
    - Note branches for later
    
  depth_markers:
    - How deep: Track investigation depth
    - Why stop: Document stopping reasons
    - What's next: Mark unexplored branches
```

### 2. Question-Everything Framework

#### 2.1 The Five Whys Plus
```yaml
questioning_framework:
  basic_five_whys:
    - Why does this exist?
    - Why was it done this way?
    - Why wasn't alternative X used?
    - Why is this important?
    - Why should we care?
    
  extended_questions:
    - What if this didn't exist?
    - When did this become necessary?
    - Who benefits from this?
    - Where else does this pattern appear?
    - How could this be different?
```

#### 2.2 Assumption Challenging
```yaml
assumption_investigation:
  identify_assumptions:
    - Implicit beliefs
    - Unstated requirements
    - "Everyone knows" statements
    
  challenge_method:
    - State assumption explicitly
    - Find counter-examples
    - Test edge cases
    - Question necessity
    
  document_findings:
    - Valid assumptions
    - Invalid assumptions
    - Partially true assumptions
```

### 3. Root Cause Analysis Techniques

#### 3.1 Drilling Down
```yaml
drill_down_process:
  level_1_symptom:
    observation: What we see
    evidence: Direct measurements
    impact: Who it affects
    
  level_2_immediate_cause:
    mechanism: How it happens
    triggers: What starts it
    frequency: When it occurs
    
  level_3_contributing_factors:
    environment: Conditions that allow it
    dependencies: What it relies on
    amplifiers: What makes it worse
    
  level_4_root_cause:
    origin: Where it really starts
    fundamental_issue: Core problem
    fix_point: Where to intervene
```

#### 3.2 Fishbone Analysis
```yaml
fishbone_categories:
  people:
    - Skills gaps
    - Communication issues
    - Process adherence
    
  process:
    - Missing steps
    - Inefficiencies
    - Unclear procedures
    
  tools:
    - Inadequate tooling
    - Misuse of tools
    - Missing automation
    
  environment:
    - Constraints
    - External factors
    - System limitations
```

### 4. Connection Discovery

#### 4.1 Hidden Relationships
```yaml
relationship_exploration:
  direct_connections:
    - Explicit references
    - Clear dependencies
    - Obvious relationships
    
  indirect_connections:
    - Shared patterns
    - Common problems
    - Similar solutions
    
  emergent_connections:
    - Unintended coupling
    - Cascading effects
    - System behaviors
```

#### 4.2 Cross-Domain Thinking
```yaml
cross_domain_analysis:
  analogies:
    - Similar problems in other domains
    - Borrowed solutions
    - Pattern matching
    
  metaphors:
    - Helpful comparisons
    - Mental models
    - Simplifying concepts
    
  transfers:
    - What can we learn
    - What applies here
    - What doesn't translate
```

### 5. Deep Dive Techniques

#### 5.1 Vertical Exploration
```bash
# Example: Exploring a performance issue deeply
vertical_exploration() {
  local ISSUE="$1"
  
  echo "Level 1: Symptom"
  # Measure and document symptom
  
  echo "Level 2: Immediate cause"
  # Profile and identify bottleneck
  
  echo "Level 3: Why the bottleneck exists"
  # Analyze code/design decisions
  
  echo "Level 4: Root architectural issue"
  # Understand fundamental constraints
  
  echo "Level 5: Original requirements/decisions"
  # Trace back to inception
}
```

#### 5.2 Horizontal Exploration
```yaml
horizontal_exploration:
  similar_issues:
    - Find related problems
    - Compare solutions
    - Identify patterns
    
  affected_areas:
    - Trace impact spread
    - Find all touchpoints
    - Map dependencies
    
  systemic_view:
    - Zoom out to system
    - See bigger picture
    - Understand context
```

### Starting Point
- Initial observation: 
- Why interesting:
- Hypothesis:

### Investigation Path
1. Step 1: [What I did] → [What I found]
2. Step 2: [What I did] → [What I found]
...

### Discoveries
- Key insight 1:
- Key insight 2:
- Unexpected finding:

### Dead Ends
- Tried X but found Y

### Further Investigation Needed
- Branch 1: [Why interesting]
- Branch 2: [Why interesting]

    what: Observable issue
    where: Location
    when: Occurrence
    
  deep_finding:
    why: Root cause
    how_deep: Levels traversed
    confidence: Certainty level
    
  implications:
    immediate: Direct impacts
    systemic: Broader effects
    future: Long-term concerns
```

## Implementation Example

### Deep Dive into Duplication Issue
```bash
# Start with surface observation
echo "Surface: Found duplicate code in 5 files"

# Level 1: Measure the duplication
diff file1.md file2.md

# Level 2: Understand why it was duplicated
git log -p file1.md file2.md

# Level 3: Trace the pattern
grep -r "similar_pattern" .

# Level 4: Understand the system need
# Review requirements and architecture

# Level 5: Question the fundamental design
# Could this be avoided entirely?
```
