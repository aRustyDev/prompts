# Shared Resources

This directory contains rigorous, reusable definitions that can be combined to achieve specific goals.

## Directory Structure

- **patterns/** - Reusable implementation patterns
- **processes/** - Step-by-step procedures for specific tasks
- **roles/** - Expert role definitions
- **schemas/** - Data structure definitions and validation schemas
- **specs/** - Formal specifications
- **templates/** - Reusable document and code templates
- **workflows/** - Multi-process orchestrations

## Usage

These resources are meant to be:
- Combined and composed for complex tasks
- Referenced by commands and other modules
- Rigorously defined with clear interfaces
- Version controlled and validated

## Key Principles

1. **Reusability**: Each resource should be self-contained and reusable
2. **Composability**: Resources should work well together
3. **Clarity**: Clear documentation and interfaces
4. **Validation**: All resources must pass validation checks
