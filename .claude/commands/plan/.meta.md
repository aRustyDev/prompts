# Project Planning Module

This directory contains the modularized project planning system, split from the original monolithic `plan.md` file.

## Structure
- **discovery.md** - Requirements gathering and discovery phase
- **analysis.md** - Problem analysis and solution exploration
- **design.md** - Architecture and design decisions
- **implementation.md** - Task breakdown and GitHub integration
- **cleanup.md** - Plan artifact cleanup utilities
- **_core.md** - Core planning logic and phase management

## Workflow
The planning process flows through phases: discovery → analysis → design → implementation. Each phase builds on the previous one.
