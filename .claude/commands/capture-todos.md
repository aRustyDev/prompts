# Capture TODOs Command

You will help analyze TODO.md files in this repository and convert them into well-organized GitHub issues. Follow these steps carefully:

## Phase 1: Discovery
1. Search for all TODO.md files in the repository using: `find . -name "TODO.md" -o -name "todo.md" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git`
2. List all found files and ask the user to confirm which ones to analyze

## Phase 2: Analysis
For each TODO.md file:
1. Read the file contents
2. Parse TODO items considering various formats:
   - Markdown headers as categories
   - List items (-, *, +, numbered)
   - Checkbox items [ ] (unchecked only)
   - Priority indicators ([HIGH], [!!], etc.)
   - Tags (#tag format)

## Phase 3: Git History Context
For each TODO item:
1. Use `git blame` to find when it was last modified
2. Use `git log -S` to track its evolution
3. Identify related code changes and commits
4. Note the context of when and why it was added

## Phase 4: Deduplication & Grouping
1. Identify similar or duplicate TODOs across files
2. Group related items by:
   - Category/header
   - Similar content
   - Common tags
   - Related functionality
3. Present grouped TODOs showing:
   - Original text
   - File location
   - Git context
   - Suggested grouping

## Phase 5: Interactive Validation
For each TODO or group:
1. Display the TODO with all context
2. If unclear or vague, ask for clarification:
   - "Fix the thing" ‚Üí What specifically needs fixing?
   - Missing context ‚Üí What is the goal?
   - Technical jargon ‚Üí What does this mean?
3. Allow user to:
   - Clarify titles
   - Add descriptions
   - Skip items
   - Merge duplicates

## Phase 6: Issue Planning
Create a structured plan:

### Organizational Units
- **Milestones**: For groups with 5+ related items
- **Projects**: For groups with 10+ items or complex workflows
- **Labels**: Based on categories, priorities, and tags

### Issue Hierarchy
- **Parent Issues**: For groups of related TODOs
- **Individual Issues**: For each TODO
- **Sub-tasks**: For TODOs with nested items

### Issue Templates
For each issue, include:
- Clear, actionable title
- Description with context
- Source reference (file:line)
- Git history context
- Acceptance criteria
- Labels and categorization

## Phase 7: Plan Presentation
Present the complete plan showing:
```
üìã ISSUE CREATION PLAN
====================

üéØ Milestones to create: X
  - Milestone Name
    Description: ...

üìä Projects to create: Y
  - Project Name
    Description: ...

üêõ Issues to create: Z
  - Parent Issue: Title
    - Child: Specific task
    - Child: Another task
  - Standalone: Independent task

Labels to use: [list of labels]
```

## Phase 8: Approval & Execution
1. Ask: "Ready to create these issues? (y/n)"
2. If approved, execute using `gh` CLI:
   - Create milestones first
   - Create projects
   - Create parent issues
   - Create child issues with parent references
   - Add to projects/milestones

## Important Guidelines

### DO:
- Preserve ALL context from git history
- Ask for clarification on vague items
- Group intelligently
- Create hierarchical structure
- Use descriptive titles
- Reference source locations

### DON'T:
- Create issues without approval
- Skip validation for unclear items
- Lose track of source files
- Create duplicate issues
- Ignore git context

## Error Handling
- If `gh` CLI isn't available, provide instructions for installation
- If not in a git repository, skip git analysis
- If no TODO files found, inform user and suggest locations

## Example Interaction
```
User: /project:capture-todos

Claude: üîç Searching for TODO.md files...
Found 3 TODO files:
1. ./TODO.md
2. ./docs/TODO.md
3. ./src/TODO.md

Shall I analyze all of these? (y/n)

[User confirms]

üìù Analyzing ./TODO.md...
Found 12 TODO items in 4 categories...

[Continues through all phases]
```

Remember: The goal is to transform scattered TODO items into a well-organized, actionable issue tracking system that preserves context and facilitates project management.
